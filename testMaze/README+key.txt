So, here is a 16x16 maze area with walls, pits, and floors,
some of which are only visible to one or the other player.
testMaze.txt is the genuine map, then there is what Player 1
and Player 2 see, each in a separate file.  There are also
doors at the beginning and end (the beginning is in the lower
left, end in the upper right).

Key:
W - Wall
F - Floor
P - Pit
D - Door

Nice and simple.
