So there are two platforms, one in rows 7 & 8, one in rows 9 & 10.  These
are movable.  Call the southern one platform A and the upper one platform
B.  (A is visible by P2, B is visible by P1.)  The left button (visible to P2) moves platform A to the right by 2 blocks and platform B to the right by 4 blocks (wrapping around to the left if it goes into the wall).  The right button (visible to P1) moves platform A to the right by 4 blocks and platform B to the right by 4 Blocks (again, wrapping around.)  Essentially the blocks exist in (Z/3Z)^2, and are currently at position (1,2).  The left button adds (1,2) to their position, the right button adds (2,2) to their position.  (The right button does nothing to change their relative position, but that's not obvious because one or the other will always wrap unless they are already lined up.)
