Button (visible by P2 only) moves the platform in rows 5 & 6 (visible by P1 only) to the right two spaces (wrapping around to the left if it's all the way on the right).  P1 can see the platform but not the switch or the other part of the bridge they want to connect it to.  P2 can see the button and the second part of the bridge, but not the moving platform.
