Each room has 3 files: the "true" maze, and then the maze at it appears
from each player's perspective.  The testRoom has all the basic aspects
of the game, including pits, traps, and walls that one player can see
and the other can't.  Might be a good starting point for testing the
engine.  The numbered rooms are drafts of the "tutorial rooms" that introduce
the mechanics of the game.  They'd also be good for testing.
