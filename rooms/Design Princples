So the basic design principles for areas is this:
-Neither player can see the path to the goal alone. They
 need to communicate about what is or isn't there to find
 the safe route.
-If one player sees a wall and the other player doesn't, the
 wall does not exist.
-If one player sees a pit and the other player doesn't, the
 pit does not exist.
-If one player sees a trap and the other player doesn't the
-trap DOES exist.
